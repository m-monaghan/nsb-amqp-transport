# Apache NMS AMQP Transport for NServiceBus

The "NServiceBus AMQP Transport" name is self-explanatory, itâ€™s a library that provides a transport option for NServiceBus to connect to ActiveMq (specifically Artemis). 

The transport utilises the Apache.NMS.AMQP library as the messaging API to a broker.

The following diagram depicts where this library sits within your application structure:

The samples have been created and tested against a local docker ActiveMq Artemis instance obtained from https://hub.docker.com/r/vromero/activemq-artemis

### Notes

./scripts/run-docker-artemis.sh
